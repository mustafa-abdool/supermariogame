This is a backup copy of a platforming "Super Mario" game I made in Grade 11 for my first programming project ever (written in python).

There were many challenges for me in this project including learning how to implement basic physics, adding AI for
enemies and creating my own level editor.

To run the game, please go into the SupermMarioProject folder then go to Mario Game Final and you can either run:

Mario Game - Final.py (for the real game - when the title screen comes up just hit the "space" button to play!)

level editor - Final.py (for the level editor - there's no real documentation on how this works, so please ask me
if it doesn't make sense)


To change the level/world the game loads in please see line 2272 of the course code where you can set the values of
WORLD and LEVEL. (Where the WORLD value is between 1 and 3, LEVEL value is between 1 and 4).

Controls are (for the main game) :

Shift - Run
Arrow keys - To navigate
'f' key - to shoot fire pellet/throw hammers if mario is in the right form
space - jump/end loading screen


Level editor keys:

When the level editor starts hit '1' or '2' followed by enter. The rest should be self explanitory.

I think that's all!|
